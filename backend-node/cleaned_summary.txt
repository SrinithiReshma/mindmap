PHOTOSYNTHESIS
  Photosynthesis makes glucose.
    Plants use sunlight.
      Some bacteria do too.
        Some protistans also.
    From carbon dioxide.
      And water.
    Glucose makes ATP.
      Through cellular respiration.
    Oxygen is formed.
  Photosynthesis equation.
    Carbon dioxide plus water.
      Makes glucose and oxygen.
  Chlorophyll is important.
    It is a green pigment.
    Converts light energy.
      Into chemical energy.
  Chlorophyll types.
    Chlorophyll a is primary.
    Accessory pigments help.
      Chlorophyll b exists.
        Also c, d, and e.
      Xanthophylls contribute.
      Carotenoids too.
        Like beta-carotene.
    Chlorophyll a absorbs light.
      Violet-blue light.
        Reddish-orange light.

CHLOROPHYLL
  Chlorophyll structure has two parts.
    A lipid tail.
      Hydrocarbon chain.
    A head.
      Flat and hydrophilic.
        Magnesium ion.
          At the center.
        Different side groups.
          On the head.
  Tail and head are linked.
    By an ester bond.


LEAVES AND LEAF STRUCTURE
  Leaves collect sunlight.
    For photosynthetic cells.
  Raw materials enter.
    Water and carbon dioxide.
  Products leave.
    Sugar and oxygen.
  Water enters roots.
    Transported by xylem.
  Stomata regulate gases.
    Prevent water loss.
  Carbon dioxide enters.
    Through stomata.
      Flanked by guard cells.
  Oxygen exits.
    Through stomata.
  Water is lost.
    Through stomata.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE CHLOROPLAST AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC MEMBRANES
  Thylakoid is basic unit.
    Flattened sacs.
      With chemicals.
  Eukaryotes have chloroplasts.
    With a membrane.
  Thylakoids are stacked.
    Called grana.
  Stroma is between grana.
  Chloroplasts have membranes.
    Three membranes.
      Make compartments.
